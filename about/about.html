                <p>First of all, thank you for taking the time to stop by and read this. People don’t really read much these days, so the fact that you’re interested enough to learn a little about me is honestly flattering.</p>
                <p>I’m <strong>William Javier</strong>. I’ve had the chance to live in a few different places—Nicaragua, Mexico, Malawi, and now Zimbabwe. If there’s one thing I’ve learned along the way, it’s how important it is to speak the local language. It opens doors, builds connections, and helps you feel truly at home wherever you are.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I’ve tried picking up languages like Afrikaans and Chichewa with mixed results. Finding good learning materials and making time to practice was always a challenge. But with English, I somehow managed to teach myself using old grammar books and repeating phrases like a parrot until they finally started to make sense.</p>
                <p>That experience is what inspired this project. I’m currently learning Shona, and I thought—why not document the process while everything is still fresh? That way, others can learn from my mistakes, pick up the tips I find along the way, and maybe feel like they’re not alone in the struggle.</p>
                <p>Outside of this, I do voluntary work in a Bible-based organization, serving the community alongside my wife. And with my background in tech, I’m building this course to be simple, practical, and hopefully helpful for anyone who wants to connect more deeply with the beautiful people of Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>Even if I’m not around one day, I hope that someone will continue to benefit from the small guidance offered here—through the little I worked to build. For that opportunity, I truly thank Jehovah God.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">And hey—if you ever want to get in touch, don’t hesitate! Even if you just want to say hi, it’ll mean a lot to know that you found something helpful here. I’d love to hear from you.</p>
